This is an opensource and free usage Web Framework. 

Is fully based on Jquery + Jquery Template + Bootstrap with additional JS features.

I decided to create this framework to easily and fast create web sites. 

**All other web frameworks are better than this**, but try it and maybe fits your requeriments.
